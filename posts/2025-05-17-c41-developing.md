In this short guide I'll summarize the procedure needed to develop **color negative film** (C41 process) <br><br>

⚠️ Remember:<br>
**ALWAYS TRIPLE CHECK THAT ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OFF BEFORE DEALING WITH EXPOSED FILM (CHECK ALSO FOR PHONES, SMARTWATCHES, ...).**

# 1. Prepare film
Before anything else, you'll need to load your film. In total darkness, load your film roll onto the spiral reel and place it inside the Jobo tank. Close the tank securely—once it's sealed, everything else can be done in the light.
Make sure to use the lid with the gear (so that it can be fitted into the machine).

# 2. Prepare the Machine

1. **Fill the rotary machine with hot water** to the top—this helps preheat the system.
2. **Set the heater** to the correct temperature. For example, Rollei kits usually require 38°C (refer to your chemistry’s instructions).
3. **Place your developer and blix bottles** into the water to bring them up to temperature.
4. **Insert the Jobo tank** (with film already loaded) into the machine.
5. **Turn the motor selector to 1** to start gentle rotation.
6. **Use a thermometer** to monitor the developer's temperature—it must stabilize at 38°C before use.

# 3. Start Developing

1. **Pre-wash the film**:  
   Slowly pour warm water into the Jobo tank. Lift the plastic tube while pouring. Fill with the amount marked on your Jobo tank, and do two quick washes (a couple of minutes each).

2. **Developer**:  
   - Measure the correct amount and confirm it’s at the right temperature (e.g. 38°C).
   - **Important**: Empty the tank of water before adding the developer.  
   - Start the timer **midway through pouring** the developer into the tank.  
   - Time depends on how used your developer is—refer to your kit's instructions and the usage log.

3. **Blix**:  
   - At the end of the developer time, immediately drain it into a beaker and pour in the same amount of blix.  
   - Start the timer again—check the manual for the correct blix duration.

4. **Washing**:  
   - Once blix is done, pour it into a separate beaker.  
   - Wash the film **three times** with warm tap water.




# 4. Stabilize and Finish

1. **Turn off the machine** and remove the film reels.
2. Gently **take the film off the reels** and place it loosely into a clean beaker.
3. Add a bit of **Adoflo (wetting agent)** and pour the **stabilizer** in to fully submerge the film.
4. **Wear gloves**: Dip your fingers and the squeegee in the stabilizer.
5. Remove the film, squeegee it gently, then attach hanging clips.
6. **Squeeze once more** to ensure even drying.
7. Put film to dry in the cabinet (20/30 min at heating level 3 should be enough)
8. Return the stabilizer to its bottle.

# 5. Clean Up

Wash all equipment thoroughly and tidy your workspace. Clean tools, empty water baths, and store your chemicals safely.
